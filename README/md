# Ongautobump - Companion program to Ongwatch

## The Quick

This is code from one of Twitch's moderators for the musician [Jonathan Ong](https://twitch.tv/JonathanOng) -- a stream that is both moderately complex (multiple bots, lots of hardware) and relatively long in the tooth (this year is the stream's 8th anniversary) -- which means it's picked up a decent number of different bots & codebases for making various parts of the stream work. As part of keeping the stream going, she's noticed several recurring pain points that have limited us in various ways

Its primary goal is to work with the Ongwatch bot's output to automatically log stream events into a google sheet.
